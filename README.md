#### rrpc

A rust library that implements RPC. Just a project to help me learn rust.

#### Plan

V1
 - [x] Base bones (lib + test)
 - [x] Get it running
 - [x] String parsing

V2
 - [ ] Pass port as a variable
 - [ ] JSON serialization
 - [ ] User can choose string/json as an option

V3
 - [ ] Multiple clients
 - [ ] Proper error handling

V4
 - [ ] Custom functions, signatures of which are available to client and definition in server
 - [ ] How would a user pass this?
